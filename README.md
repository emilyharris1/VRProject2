Music interaction
My idea is to implement different ways to play a few musical notes
One way to do this is to point your raycast at a specific object to hear a different note 
Another way to do this is to teleport to different pads that each play a different note when stepped on
A third way to do this is to shoot at and hit targets with bullets. Each target will play a different note
I have some other ideas if I find these ones don't challenge me enough
