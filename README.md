Music interaction

My idea is to implement different ways to play musical notes.

One way to do this is to shoot at and hit targets with bullets. Each target will play a different note. 

Another way to do this is to teleport to different pads that each play a different note when landed on.

A third way to do this is to point your raycast at a specific object to hear a different note depending on what letter the object starts with.
